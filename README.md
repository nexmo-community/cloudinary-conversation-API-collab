<!-- Add a paragraph about the project. What does it do? Who is it for? Is it actively supported? Your reader just clicked on a random link from another web page and has no idea what Nexmo is ... -->

In collaboration with the Cloudinary API, this app allows you to take a screenshot of your desktop and a Nexmo Conversation chatlog, annotate the image with important contextual details of the conversation, and save and organize that image in the cloud for easy future access!

### Quick steps:

1. Clone this directory
2. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

3. Start a Ngrok tunnel
4. Run your app!

```bash
npm start
```
